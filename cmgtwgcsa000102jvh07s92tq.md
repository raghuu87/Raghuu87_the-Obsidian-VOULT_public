This video lesson provides **installation steps for Git Bash and Git on Windows**.


---

## **Installation Process**

1. **Download:** Navigate to **Git for Windows (gitforwindows.org)** and download the Git SCM installer.

1. **Run Installer:** Open the downloaded installer, agree to the license, and select the installation location.

1. **Components:** When prompted to select components, ensure the checkbox next to **Git Bash** is selected.

1. **Defaults:** For the rest of the installation steps, keep the **default selected options** and continue clicking **Next** until the installation is complete.

## **Verification and Setup in VS Code**

Once installation is finished, verify and set up Git Bash as the default terminal in VS Code:

1. **Open Terminal:** In VS Code, go to the top menu, click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.

1. **Select Git Bash:** In the new terminal window, click the dropdown button next to the plus sign ($+$) and select **Git Bash**. You should see a dollar sign ($) in the terminal.

1. **Set as Default:** To configure Git Bash as the default shell, open the **Command Palette** (**View** > **Command Palette**).

1. **Select Profile:** Search for **"Select Default Profile"**, select it from the dropdown, and then choose **Git Bash**. This ensures all new terminals open with Git Bash.

**Note:** Mac users can skip this lesson as Bash is pre-installed on their operating system. The next lesson will cover the command line and Bash in detail.
